Exercise 3:
- Our sales have increased and so our app should now be able to handle more than 1 list. 
- Modify the app from exercise 2 so that we can now handle a List of ClientSale objects that contain a name and a PricedProduct list with offers. 
- Create all the classes or functions you think you need to achieve that.
- We want to receive as a result an array containing a new List with the summary price for each ClientSale in descending order.
